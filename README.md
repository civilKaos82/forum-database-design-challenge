##Learning Competencies 

##Summary 

 Forums have been around for almost 2 decades. Delve into the underlying database!

Requirements:

1. A user can submit stories
2. Users can vote stories up or down
3. Users can comment on stories
4. Users can reply to other comments

## Objectives

### Design the schema

Design a database schema for a forum that meets the requirements.


Use [SQL Designer](/sql.html) to create your schema.  When you are done, save the XML of your schema and copy it into the gist. Then, take a screenshot of your final schema design, and upload it using a free image-upload service like [Min.us](http://minus.com).  Paste the URL of the screenshot into your gist (before your XML code).
